ycoreutils is coreutils clone that I write for fun, to compile
it, create and edit config.mak to override defaults, and run
make. To install it run "make install". But I don't recommend
installing it yet, since it's not ready for anything, and
I doubt it will ever be.

Defaults configuration in Makefile uses musl and makes
statically linked binaries. But of course, you can also
link it against glibc or another C library. There is no
rule or option for shared library and dynlinking, but
you can also do that if you try hard enough ;)
