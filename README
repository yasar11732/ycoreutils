ycoreutils is coreutils clone that I write for fun, to compile
it, create and edit config.mak to override defaults, and run
make. This will create binaries in bin/ folder. There are also
3 programs written in assembly. In order to compile them, first
go to asm/lib and make and then, go to asm/ and make again. Your
binaries will be at asm/bin

Default configuration in Makefile uses musl and makes
statically linked binaries. But of course, you can also
link it against glibc or another C library.

Commands sort of working for now:
echo:
    except --help and --version options, identical to
    echo command you would expect. Seems to be working.
mkdir:
    supports -m, -p and -v options. Behaves like what you would
    expect. Seems to be working.
cp, id:
    these two are partially working, but not quite there yet.
whoami:
    Works.
yes:
    Works.
true, false:
    They are in asm/bin folder. They work.
cat:
    It's in asm/bin folder. Works but accepts no
    arguments. And, if an argument is "-" or starts
    with "-", reads stdin. This should probably changed.
tee:
    It accept -a option, and it works I guess.
printenv:
    Accepts -0, and it works!
